# Feline Utility Rovers :: UNOFFICIAL

Kerbetrotter Ltd. is happy to announce its newest creation from the Feline Utility Rover series: The Lynx Rover.

A medium sized versatile rover that is capable to operate independently in the harshest environments. It is mainly
designed to operate on other planets, but also in the outback of Kerbin.

Depending on your configuration it can be used for crew transport, mobile research including a laboratory or as a transport for various resources. You can also use bellowed joints to be more flexible in difficult terrain or use hover engines to pass water. It now also includes a small propeller for when the rover is swimming.

This is an unofficial, non authorised repository for **Feline Utility Rovers** for historical reference and troubleshooting.
